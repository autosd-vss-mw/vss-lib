Hardware vendors (baremetal) who do not simulate their hardware but want to send signals can use the EmitHardwareSignal method to send real-time signals to the D-Bus interface.

This method is useful when hardware devices (like sensors) need to communicate directly with the D-Bus server in real-time.
